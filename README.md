# CFViewer

CFViewer is a tool that gives an interface to view a long twitter conversation in
a compact tree view. Twitter web conversation view is only helpful for linear 
conversations. But the most intersting conversations have branches and
sometimes the most important tidbits are hidden in those branches.

CFViewer aims to help you follow a long branched conversation in a slightly
more convenient manner.

The project was born on an interesting Sunday evening.
